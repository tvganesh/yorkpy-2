##**Introduction**



You can clone/download the code at Github [yorkpy](https://github.com/tvganesh/yorkpy)

This post has been published to RPubs at [yorkpy-Part1](http://rpubs.com/tvganesh/454443)

You can download this post as PDF at [IPLT20-yorkpy-part1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/167fSf64L_CkmuWHi-uzN1ceENF3AEOEh/view?usp=sharing)

The IPL T20 functions in yorkpy are 

###1. Functions related to team performance in match
The following function can be used to analyze the IPL team performance in a  T20 match

a. teamBattingScorecardMatch()
b. teamBatsmenPartnershipMatch()
c. teamBatsmenVsBowlersMatch()
d. teamBowlingScorecardMatch()
e. teamBowlingWicketKindMatch()
f. teamBowlingWicketRunsMatch()
g. teamBowlingWicketMatch()
h. teamBowlersVsBatsmenMatch()
i. matchWormChart()

###2. Install the package using 'pip install'
```{python}
import pandas as pd
import yorkpy.analytics as yka
#pip install yorkpy
```


###3. Load a yaml file from Cricsheet
There are 2  functions that can be to  convert the IPL Twenty20 yaml files to pandas
dataframeare

a) convertYaml2PandasDataframeT20 
b) convertAllYaml2PandasDataframesT20

*Note 1: While I have already converted the IPL T20 files, you will need to use these functions for future IPL matches*

###4. Convert and save IPL T20 yaml file to pandas dataframe
This function will convert a IPL T20 IPL yaml file, in the format as specified in [Cricsheet](http://cricsheet.org/format/) to pandas dataframe. This will be saved as
as CSV file in the target directory. The name of the file wil  have the following format team1-team2-date.csv. The IPL T20 zip file can be downloaded from [IPL Premier League Matches](https://cricsheet.org/). An example of how a yaml file can be converted to a dataframe and saved is  shown below.
```{python}
import pandas as pd
import yorkpy.analytics as yka
#convertYaml2PandasDataframe(".\\1082593.yaml","..\ipl", ..\\data")
```



###5. Convert and save all IPL T20 yaml files to dataframes
This function will convert all IPL T20 yaml files from a source directory to dataframes, and save it in the target directory, with the names as mentioned above. Since I have already done this, I will not be executing this again. You can download the zip of all the converted RData files from Github at [yorkpyData](https://github.com/tvganesh/yorkpyData)
```{python}
import pandas as pd
import yorkpy.analytics as yka
#convertAllYaml2PandasDataframes("..\\ipl", "..\\data")

```


You can download the the zip of the files and use it directly in the functions as follows.For the analysis below I chosen a set of random IPL matches

The randomly selected IPL T20 matches are

* Chennai Super Kings vs Kings Xi Punjab, 2014-05-30
* Deccan Chargers vs Delhi Daredevils, 2012-05-10
* Gujarat Lions vs Mumbai Indians, 2017-04-29
* Kolkata Knight Riders vs Rajasthan Royals, 2010-04-17
* Rising Pune Supergiants vs Royal Challengers Bangalore, 2017-04-29


###6. Team batting scorecard
The function below computes the batting score card of a team in an IPL match. The scorecard gives the balls faced, the runs scored, 4s, 6s and strike rate. The example below is based on the CSK KXIP match on 30 May 2014.

You can check against the actual scores in this match [Chennai Super Kings-Kings XI Punjab-2014-05-30](https://www.google.com/search?q=Chennai+Super+Kings-Kings+XI+Punjab-2014-05-30&oq=Chennai+Super+Kings-Kings+XI+Punjab-2014-05-30&aqs=chrome..69i57.740j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#sie=m;/g/11f54j05vm;5;/m/03b_lm1;tb1;fp;1;;)


## Print summary
```{python}
import pandas as pd
import os
import yorkpy.analytics as yka
dir1= "C:\\software\\cricket-package\\yorkpyIPLData\\data1"
path=os.path.join(dir1,"Chennai Super Kings-Delhi Daredevils-allMatches.csv")
csk_dd_matches = pd.read_csv(path)
m=yka.teamBatsmenPartnershiOppnAllMatches(csk_dd_matches,'Delhi Daredevils',report="summary")
print(m)


```
## 2 Print detailed

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import os
import yorkpy.analytics as yka
dir1= "C:\\software\\cricket-package\\yorkpyIPLData\\data1"
path=os.path.join(dir1,"Deccan Chargers-Mumbai Indians-allMatches.csv")
dc_mi_matches = pd.read_csv(path)
theTeam='Deccan Chargers'
m=yka.teamBatsmenPartnershiOppnAllMatches(dc_mi_matches,theTeam,report="detailed", top=4)
print(m)
```

## 3 Plot partnership chart
**Note**: Many of the plots include an additional parameters plot which is either True or False. The default value is plot=True. When plot=True the plot will be displayed. When plot=False the data frame will be returned to the user. The user can use this to create an interactive chart using one of the packages like rcharts, ggvis,googleVis or plotly. 

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import os
import yorkpy.analytics as yka
dir1= "C:\\software\\cricket-package\\yorkpyIPLData\\data1"
path=os.path.join(dir1,"Gujarat Lions-Kings XI Punjab-allMatches.csv")
gl_kxip_matches = pd.read_csv(path)
yka.teamBatsmenPartnershipOppnAllMatchesChart(gl_kxip_matches,'Kings XI Punjab','Gujarat Lions', plot=True, top=4, partnershipRuns=20)
```


###7.  Plot the team batting partnerships as chart




```{python batsmenPartnership,cache=TRUE,fig.width=10}
import pandas as pd
import os
import yorkpy.analytics as yka
dir1= "C:\\software\\cricket-package\\yorkpyIPLData\\data1"
path=os.path.join(dir1,"Kolkata Knight Riders-Rising Pune Supergiants-allMatches.csv")
kkr_rps_matches = pd.read_csv(path)
m=yka.teamBatsmenPartnershipOppnAllMatchesChart(kkr_rps_matches,'Rising Pune Supergiants','Kolkata Knight Riders', plot=False, top=5, partnershipRuns=20)
print(m)

```

###8. Batsmen vs Bowler - Plot
The function below computes and plots the performances of the batsmen vs the bowlers. As before the plot parameter can be set to True or False. By default it is plot=True

rr_rcb_matches = pd.read_csv(path)
yka.teamBatsmenVsBowlersOppnAllMatches(rr_rcb_matches,'Rajasthan Royals',"Royal Challengers Bangalore",plot=True,top=3,runsScored=20)



```

###9 BatsmenVsBowlersOppnAllMatches
This function provides the bowling performance, the number of overs bowled,
maidens, runs conceded. wickets taken and economy rate for  the IPL match

path=os.path.join(dir1,"Royal Challengers Bangalore-Chennai Super Kings-allMatches.csv")
rcb_csk_matches = pd.read_csv(path)
scorecard=teamBattingScorecardOppnAllMatches(rcb_csk_matches,'Royal Challengers Bangalore',"Chennai Super Kings")
print(scorecard)


```

###11. Wicket vs Runs conceded
The plots below provide the wickets taken and the runs conceded by the bowler in the IPL T20 match

##Conclusion
This post included all functions between 2 IPL teams from the package yorkpy for IPL Twenty20 matches.As mentioned above the yaml match files have been already converted to dataframes and are available for download from Github at [yorkpyData](https://github.com/tvganesh/yorkpyData)


After having used Python and R for analytics, Machine Learning and Deep Learning, I have now realized that neither language is superior or inferior. Both have, some good packages and some that are not so well suited.
